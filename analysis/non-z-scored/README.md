# Notes

Most of the analysis in this folder has been superseded by code in `analysis/z-scored` as it contains the set of all problems (*z*-scored) rather than the subset that was initially analysed here. This means any similar analyses/scripts between `analysis/z-scored` and this folder may be more up-to-date and accurate in the former. However, the analysis contained in `analysis/non-z-scored/comp-to-benchmarks.R` in this folder is not duplicated elsewhere.
