# feature-set-classification
Compares various time-series feature sets on a set of classification tasks.

## Premise

Based on [previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10914) comparing numerous time-series feature set software packages, this work extends the findings to directly compare the sets on a set of classification problems from the [UEA & UCR Time Series Classification repository](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com).
